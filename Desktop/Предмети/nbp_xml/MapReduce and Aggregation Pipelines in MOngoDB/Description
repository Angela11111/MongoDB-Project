A group seminar work on finding the optimal quering method in the non-relational databse MongoDB. 
Includes testing the MapReduce function, agreggation pipelines and single aggregation functions on a dataset from Udacity, after which
the one with best performaces is compared to quering in a relational database - PostgreSQL over the same dataset. 
To show the practical usage of the best method, it is then implemented in a movie-predictor based on Naive-Bayes.
